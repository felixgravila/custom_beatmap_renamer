# Custom beatmap renamer
## Description

a small script to help rename beatmap folders. A long list of folders named something like "236173d5ba7dc379d480b9cb5fb6b4fa5abe77da" is unmanageable, and searching for files doesn't help. This script reads the info file within the folder and attempts to rename the folders using the format {author_name}-{song-name}-({map-creator}). Bonus: it finds duplicates.

## Usage:

Copy .py file to CustomLevels folder and execute it using python from the folder
